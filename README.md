Android Basics Nanodegree Project 2

This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned
in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that
allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal is to create a Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to
keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.
To build this project, you can follow along with the practice set and customize
the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport.
